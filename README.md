# Admission_Prediction_ML_Project
Predict whether a student will be admitted to a university or not, using ML models. (Maximum Accuracy achieved: 92.05%)

The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.
The parameters included:
1. GRE Scores (out of 340)
2. TOEFL Scores (out of 120)
3. University Rating (out of 5)
4. Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength (out of 5)
5. Undergraduate GPA (out of 10)
6. Research Experience (either 0 or 1)
7. Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1)

ML models used in this project are:
1. Multiple linear regressor (MLR)
2. Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
3. MLR with PCA
4. RFR with PCA

Plot of actual and predicted values for all the four models along with their MSE, RMSE and R2_SCORE is shown and the Best Model is calculated.
